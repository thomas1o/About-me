    <string name="bio"> Hi, my name is Thomas.
    \n\nThis is my second project using Kotlin.
        \n\nI am hoping to practice Kotlin really well for 2 months.
        \n\nI do not know what else to write.
        \n\nSo I am writing some random things.
        \n\nIn the app make it feel I have written an lot of stuff
        \n\nHonestly speaking, I am just repeating the same thing
        over and over again to make it longer and use the scroll feature.
        \n\nOK still the scroll has not started so I am just writing some other things.
        \n\n I hope it is now long enough for the scroll to start.\n</string>
